The lighting indicates that the photo was taken in daylight, with shadows cast by the rocks.\n\nThe etched markings on the rock are not clearly legible and appear to be abstract or possibly ancient symbols or petroglyphs. They consist of various lines and shapes, including what might be interpreted as a series of intersecting lines or a series of dots and lines forming a pattern. The markings are subtle and not sharply defined, which makes it difficult to determine their exact nature or meaning. There is no visible text or inscriptions that can be confidently identified as readable writing.
